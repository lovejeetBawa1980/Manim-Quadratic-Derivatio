## üìñ Introduction

The quadratic equation is a fundamental concept in mathematics. Understanding its derivation helps students grasp its applications in various fields. This project utilizes the Manim library, which is a powerful tool for creating mathematical animations. With this repository, you can create your own video on the quadratic equation derivation while having fun coding.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Animations**: Visualize the steps of the quadratic equation derivation.
- **Educational Content**: Learn the derivation process through engaging visuals.
- **Customizable Code**: Modify the animations as per your needs.
- **Community Contributions**: Open for improvements and new features.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lovejeetBawa1980/Manim-Quadratic-Derivatio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Manim-Quadratic-Derivatio
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Manim**:
   Follow the [official Manim installation guide](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/index.html) to set up Manim on your machine.

## üöÄ Usage

After setting up the project, you can run the animation script. 

1. **Run the Animation**:
   Use the following command to render the video:
   ```bash
   manim -pql main.py QuadraticDerivation
   ```
   This command generates a low-quality preview of the animation. For a higher quality, replace `-pql` with `-pqh`.

2. **View the Output**:
   Once the rendering is complete, the output video will be saved in the `media/videos` directory. You can find your animated video there!

3. **Edit the Code**:
   Feel free to explore the `main.py` file. Modify the animation sequences or add new features to make the project your own.
